# Overview
Tic-tac-toe is a game for 2 players, X and O, who take turns selecting positions on a 3x3 board. 
To win, one player must manage to place three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/tic-tac-toe/example.png)
In this example, player O has won, as they have marked 3 of their symbols along the top row.

# Goals
In the [previous post](https://p-mckenzie.github.io/2020/07/30/tic-tac-toe/), I implemented the tic-tac-toe 
game in a single class, `TicTacToe()`. I also programmed an AI with the [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy) 
for playing a perfect game of tic-tac-toe, so the user playing against the computer can do no better than draw,
and that logic is held in `TicTacToe.make_computer_move()`.

In this post, I'll describe how I leveraged the Pygame package to provide an interface between
the user and the AI.

## Tic-tac-toe game
Before going further, let's initialize the class we discussed in pt. 1, `TicTacToe`, from `BaseGame.py`.
```python
from BaseGame import TicTacToe
game = TicTacToe()
```
We'll use this to track and update the board state, as well as telling us when the game ends,
and who the winner is (or whether it's a draw).

# Pygame basics
The first step to making the UI is to import the pygame package, and initialize pygame.
```python
import pygame
pygame.init()
```
Now this is done, we need to open a window for the program to run in. Here, I'm manually setting
the screen height and width, then filling the entire screen with a solid white background.
```python
SCREEN_WIDTH = 650
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 360

DISPLAYSURF = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH,SCREEN_HEIGHT))

WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
DISPLAYSURF.fill(WHITE)
```

# Drawing objects
All we have right now is a blank canvas, so next we'll need to draw, or "blit", objects 
(perhaps representing characters, scenery, information, etc) onto the canvas.

## Background
In my case for tic-tac-toe, I'm going to start by drawing a background of the 3x3 grid onto the
white canvas. This `tictactoe_background.jpg` was lovingly crafted in MS paint, and looks like:

![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/tic-tac-toe/tictactoe_background.jpg)

First, we have to create a pygame object to hold the image, called a [Surface](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html), 
which we will then "blit" onto the canvas background, `DISPLAYSURF`.

```python
background = pygame.image.load("./assets/tictactoe_background.jpg")
DISPLAYSURF.blit(background, (0,0))
```
Note that we are calling `DISPLAYSURF.blit(background, (0,0))` where tuple (0,0) indicates the (x,y)
location we'd like to align the top left of the `background` Surface object to, relative to the top left
of `DISPLAYSURF`. Passing (10,0) instead would move `background` down 10 pixels, while passing (0,10) instead
would move `background` to the right 10 pixels.

So now, the pygame window would just look like:
![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/tic-tac-toe/blank_pygame_sc.png)

## Marked locations
Now we have the grid background, but need to fill in any marked locations with the 
appropriate symbol (X for the user, O for the AI). To do this, we'll use what's called a [Sprite](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html)
in pygame. 

What's a sprite? Basically, it's just a class that represents some surface, at some location, with some 
attributes. The class is very versatile, as sprites can be easily updated & redrawn. 
For example, a single sprite could represent 
a running character, and during the "game loop" the character's position (part of the Sprite object) would be updated,
and the sprite would be redrawn at the new position. 

In our tic-tac-toe game, I'll use a single sprite to represent each location in the 3x3 grid that can be marked.
Initially, the sprites will not be displayed, but once they are selected by either the player or the AI,
then they will be updated with the appropriate image (either an X or O). I'll extend the base 
`pygame.sprite.Sprite` class into my own `block` class:

```python
class block(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, i):
        super().__init__() 
        self.surf = pygame.Surface((100, 100))
        self.rect = self.surf.get_rect(topleft=((i//3)*SCREEN_WIDTH/3+50, 10+(i%3)*SCREEN_HEIGHT/3))
        self.i = i
        
    def display(self, user):
        if user==1:
            self.image = pygame.image.load("./assets/x.jpg")
        else:
            self.image = pygame.image.load("./assets/o.jpg")

sprites = [block(i) for i in range(9)]
```
`sprites` is now a list that holds 9 individual blocks. Each `block.rect` describes where, in a 3x3
grid, the block would be placed. Note that currently the blocks do not have background images, 
as `block.display(user)` has not been called. Also, they have not yet been
drawn to the screen! They just exist in memory and are not visible. 
However, highlighting where they *would* be, the blocks are distributed approximately: 

![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/tic-tac-toe/yellow_pygame_sc.png)

Note that each block also stores `block.i`, where `i` ranges from 0 through 8, indicating the "seed"
with which that block was made.


# User input
We've got all the objects we need, now it's time to start the game and get user input.

I've designed the game so that the user always goes first, so they will be presented with a blank 
screen and have to click on the location they want to mark. Let's imagine they click
somewhere in the middle of the screen:
![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/tic-tac-toe/mouse_pygame_sc.png)

How can pygame catch this? Well, we constantly want to be checking for an [event](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html),
which is a fancy way of saying a mouse click, button press, or joystick input of some sort.

These events come in a queue, accessed through `pygame.event.get()`, so we want to loop through this
list, checking if any of the events are a down click (`event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`)
of the left (`event.button=1`) mouse button.
```python
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN and event.button == 1:
        # location of the click
        x,y = event.pos
```
From the event object, we can access the x,y coordinates where the event happened, and process the click.

# Processing input
We now want to convert the x,y coordinates of the user input to a meaningful "move" on the tic-tac-toe
board. Remember `sprites`, the list of block sprites from before? The [Sprite](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html) 
class comes a function to determine if a collision has happened. We'll leverage it by looping through our
`sprites`, checking if any of them overlap with the user's input.

However, even if the user's input collides with one of the block sprites, we *also* need to check
if that location is available. To do this, we'll reference `game.board`, which stores the current 
board state, and check if that location is zero (has not been selected by a user prior to this point).
If it's unfilled, fill it, check whether the game has ended, and if not allow the computer to go next.
```python
for sprite in sprites:
    if sprite.rect.collidepoint(x,y):
        if game.board[sprite.i//3, sprite.i%3]==0:
            # update the game board                        
            game.board[sprite.i//3, sprite.i%3] = 1

            # change the user so the computer goes next
            game.game_finished = game.is_game_finished()
            game.user *= -1
            break
```
So, taking it back to our example where the user clicks in the middle of the blank board:
![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/tic-tac-toe/mouse_pygame_sc.png)

This user input overlaps with sprite #4, so `game.board` will be updated to:
```
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```
This indicates that only the center location has been selected, and that has been selected by
the user, not the AI. We can call `game.make_computer_move()` to allow the AI to do it's turn,
then resume processing user input. Note the computer uses -1 to denote selected locations in 
`game.board`, so the new state would look like:

```
[[-1, 0, 0],
 [ 0, 1, 0],
 [ 0, 0, 0]]
```

# Displaying game state
Now that the user has made their input, we need to display the results. In our example,
we need to display that their click resulted in the middle location being filled,
and that the AI selected the top left.

In pygame terms, we need to re-draw everything we want displayed, then update the display
by calling `pygame.display.update()`. 

So what do we want displayed? First, the background image
(the 3x3 grid). Then more importantly, we want any sprites that have been selected, with the 
appropriate image displayed.

To accomplish this, we'll enumerate through `game.board.flatten()`, which will take us through
each `element` in `game.board` and the range 0 through 8, which is coincidentally `i`, the index
of our sprites. 

If `element!=0`, then that location in `game.board` has been selected by either
the player or the AI. We'll select the appropriate `sprite` from the list `sprites`, update
`sprite` to display the appropriate image (X if the user selected, O if the AI selected). This
determination is made off of `element`, which will be 1 if the user made that selection, but -1 
if the AI made it.

```python
# update the board
DISPLAYSURF.blit(background, (0,0))
for i,element in enumerate(game.board.flatten()):
    if element!=0:
        sprite = sprites[i]

        # set whether the sprite is an X or O
        sprite.display(element)

        DISPLAYSURF.blit(sprite.image, sprite.rect)

pygame.display.update()
```
After updating the display, the screen now shows the user:
![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/tic-tac-toe/2_moves_sc.png)



# Game loop
It's time now to put all the pieces together into a loop. We have all the fundamental elements 
we need to run the game, and now simply need to repeatedly manage and update the game state, 
while watching for user input. Let's build this now. 

The `game` class I wrote maintains a `game.game_finished` boolean, indicating whether the game has ended
(either due to a player winning, or a draw being reached). So while the game is not finished,
we need to accept input and update the screen.

```python
while not game.game_finished:
    if game.user==1:
        # ------- process inputs -------
        ...
    
    else:   
        # ------- make computer move --------
        ...

    # ----------- update display --------------
    ...
    
pygame.display.quit()
pygame.quit()
```
This simply assembles all the pieces we've already discussed! After breaking out of the loop,
we close the display window and the program itself.

# Extras
Pygame is capable of handling **much** more complicated programs, and I have barely scratched 
the surface of what it can do. However, before calling it quits on this project, I also wanted 
to explore a little bit.

I set myself the additional challenge of letting the user repeatedly play games of tic-tac-toe,
until they decided to stop, while updating them on their win/draw/lose record so far.

## Repeatedly playing
To play multiple games, I need another loop, to repeatedly call the game loop! I start off the program
with a variable called `play`, and run a new game as long as `play` is `True`.

```python
play = True
while play:
    game = TicTacToe()
    # -------- game loop -----------
    ...
    play = keep_playing()
    
pygame.display.quit()
pygame.quit()
```
Note that I have moved closing the display to outside the new loop, and have a new function
called `keep_playing()` that I'll discuss momentarily.

## Keeping score
I'd also like to keep track of the wins, draws, and losses the user experiences, as they
play multiple games.

I'll use a list, `records`, to keep track of 3 integers, representing the number of wins,
draws, and losses for the user during this session, respectively.

> Note the AI has been programmed to be unbeatable so it should be impossible for the user to win,
but I've included this metric in the counter, just in case.

`records` is a global variable, so I'll initialize all values to 0 outside the outer game loop.
The `game` class tracks `game.winner`, which will be 1 if the user wins, -1 if the AI wins, and
0 if it is a draw, so I'll use this value to increment the appropriate entry in `records`.

```python
records = [0,0,0]
...

while play:
    # -------- inner game loop -----------
    ...
    records[game.winner*-1+1] += 1
    play = keep_playing()
    
pygame.display.quit()
pygame.quit()
```

## Additional input
After the current game ends and the record has been updated, I need another input from the 
user, to indicate if they would like to play again. For this, I'm going to display other 
objects to give the user different information,
including their current win/draw/lose record.

I'll hold all this logic inside a `keep_playing()` function, and update the `play` variable 
after each game based on the result of this function.

I'm going to request the user press a button to play again, so I need to create a button from
the pygame [Rect](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html) class, so it can be colored in,
and I can again use `collidepoint(x,y)` to determine if the user clicked on the button.

```python
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
font_small = pygame.font.SysFont("Verdana", 20)

def keep_playing():
    # draw button and background
    DISPLAYSURF.fill(WHITE)
    
    button = Rect(SCREEN_WIDTH/2-150, SCREEN_HEIGHT/2-50, 300, 100)
    pygame.draw.rect(DISPLAYSURF, GREEN, button)
    
    text = font_small.render('Click here to play again!', True, BLACK)
    text_rect = text.get_rect(center=(SCREEN_WIDTH/2, SCREEN_HEIGHT/2))
    DISPLAYSURF.blit(text, text_rect)
    ...
```
What this does, simply, is display a **very** green box, approximately centered on the screen,
with text on it, encouraging the user to click inside the box. It looks like this:
![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/tic-tac-toe/clickhere_sc.png)

I'll also write the current win/draw/loss record from `records` to the screen.
```python
def keep_playing():
    ...
    
    # draw results
    DISPLAYSURF.blit(font_small.render('User wins: {}'.format(records[0]), True, BLACK), 
                     (0, 0))
    DISPLAYSURF.blit(font_small.render('Ties: {}'.format(records[1]), True, BLACK), 
                     (0, text_rect.height))
    DISPLAYSURF.blit(font_small.render('Computer wins: {}'.format(records[2]), True, BLACK), 
                     (0, text_rect.height*2))
    ...
```
Now, (after a tie), the window would look like:
![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/tic-tac-toe/ties_sc.png)

But wait! We still need to "listen" for user input, so that means another loop, watching 
for events. We'll use the same logic as before, checking if the user's right click
collides with the `button`.

```python
def keep_playing():
    # ------- update display -----
    ...
    
    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN and event.button == 1:
                # location of the click
                x,y = event.pos

                if button.collidepoint(x,y):
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
```
Note there is no break out of the loop! Either the user clicks the button, where `keep_playing()`
will return `True`, or they click outside the button, where `keep_playing()` will return `False`.
Until the user clicks, the screen will keep waiting for input.

# Conclusion
Now we have a fully-functioning, repeating tic-tac-toe game, against a competent opponent.
I hope this provided an interesting, yet simple example of the types of things the
pygame package allows you to do.
